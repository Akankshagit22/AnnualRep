                During the pandemic, I observed that my
                friends from other schools and even their
                families faced a lot of trouble dealing with their
                emotions while it was much easier for me and
                my parents because my teachers used to
                regularly check-in on us and because of the
                conditioning from years of
                Socio-Emotional-Ethical Learning (SEEL)
                routines.

            <div className="dig-2" id="digPos-3-2"></div>

                <p>
                We had weekly circle-time conversations
                through which our teachers would infer the
                challenges we faced and then address those
                through one-on-one counselling.
                In these circle-times, students discussed
                topics concerning them such as bullying, child
                marriages, managing finances and time etc.</p>

                We also had a 10-minute self-reflection session
                every morning wherein we would introspect by
                writing or drawing. This practice really helped
                us to increase our self-awareness, manage
                emotions, and practice values such as kindness,
                compassion and gratitude in our daily lives.

                One of the best things I learnt through SEEL
                sessions is to help the ones in need without
                expecting anything in return, and thus was born
                Project Sitara.<br/><br/>
                During my summer-holiday visits to my village, I
                observed that the education scene suffered
                from poor teacher-attendance, outdated
                pedagogy, poor infrastructure etc. 
                </p>
                <div onClick={onShowMore} className="btn_read-more">
                <Image src="/assets/images/arrow.png" layout='fill'
    objectFit='contain' alt=""/>

                I saw instances of 3rd graders not being able to write
                their names. This really made me feel like
                giving back to the place where I come from. So
                during my 8th grade summer vacation, I started
                Project Sitara with the guidance of my school
                leader. Through this project, I helped children at
                my village improve their reading and writing
                abilities. We also exchanged our socio-cultural
                experiences through stories.
