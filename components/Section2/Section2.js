                    This is my classroom, which I really missed
                    when the schools were shut during lockdown.
                    But our school&lsquo;s quick shift to blended-learning
                    combining traditional-classroom learning with
                    digital methods, re-established that connect.
                    The digital tablets that Akanksha provided to
                    students and teachers enabled seamless
                    learning via synchronous platforms like Zoom
                    and asynchronous platforms like Whatsapp.

                My school has always included innovative
                teaching methods: We had project-based
                learning and I particularly recollect a project
                wherein the motive was to teach us how
                research is done and how it is presented to a
                large audience. Each group was assigned a
                region and we had to explore its culture,
                livelihoods etc.</p>

                <p> Our group was assigned the
                north-east of India and it was fascinating to
                learn about the region. I remember preparing a
                lot of charts, data-visualisation diagrams and
                doing a lot of Google keyword research which
                otherwise would have been a boring activity if it
                was not taught through project-based learning.
